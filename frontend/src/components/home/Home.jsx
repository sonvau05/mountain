                <p>
                  Celebrating 38 years of leading successful expeditions in 2024,
                  Alpine Ascents International, Inc. is a leader in the climbing
                  industry and has been instrumental in setting guiding standards
                  in the international climbing community for most of our history.
                  This year, we will offer more than 30 different expeditions and
                  50 training courses in 14 countries, including the Arctic and
                  Antarctic regions. These expeditions range from three-day climbs
                  of Mount Rainier to training courses in the North Cascades and
                  Alaska, and ascents of the highest mountains around the world.
                  Alpine Ascents' philosophy is based on a true love and
                  understanding of mountain wilderness. Our mission and goals are
                  simple: by using the best climbing talent in the country, we
                  offer the opportunity for climbers at all levels to achieve
                  their personal aspirations through quality, challenging, safety
                  conscious and fun expeditions. Unparalleled mountain adventures
                  are what we do.
